### Introduction
I have developed web applications in PHP, Java, and Siebel.  With PHP, my most recent frameworks were Laravel and Yii.  The frontend frameworks were Vue2, Vue3, and Kendo.  As far as tools, I prefer Sublime IDE but I have used Eclipse and Netbeans.  My college used Visual Studio.  Also, my companies were very different in their approaches.  The first one was more of a contract company while my other companies owned their code.  

### The Reason
Typically code is not visible.  We write a lot of code for different companies but no one can see what we've done.  There are valid reasons for this, including security risks and preserving intellectual property.  As I do not have a robust GitHub, I sought to alleviate this problem.

### The Plan
There are plenty of ways that I can improve this workspace.  For the previous projects, I focused on technologies that I didn't yet know.  However, I read a post about if you start with an idea to solve, it becomes a better-looking repository.  So I've started asking for projects.  I think that www.frontendmentor.io will help with that though.     

### The Risks
- Plenty of top-level GitHub accounts are not seen due to the resume not being impressive enough in the first 30 seconds
- Plenty of employers discount personal projects as they believe that they can be "faked" due to tutorials
- People that have never been fired and/or laid off have less time to do personal projects so a better GitHub profile could be a red flag
